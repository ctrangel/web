= Modify Data Page Documentation for World of Jars

== Overview

This document describes the functionality and structure of the "Modify Data" page within the World of Jars inventory management system. It allows users to update the details of existing jar entries in the inventory. This page includes form inputs for selecting jar types, updating quantities, and changing locations or status, as well as a dynamic data table displaying the current inventory.

== Page Structure

The "Modify Data" page consists of a navigation bar for easy access across the application and a form for modifying jar data. The page leverages Bootstrap for styling, Grid.js for data representation, and Toastr for feedback messages.

=== Key Elements

- *Navigation Bar*: Links to other sections like Home, View Data, Reports, and the active Modify Data page.
- *Modification Form*: Allows the selection and updating of jar entries. Fields include jar type, quantity, location, and status.
- *Data Table*: Displays existing inventory items with dynamic styling based on quantity and status.

== External Dependencies

- Bootstrap: Ensures responsive design and provides form and modal components.
- Toastr: Used for displaying success or error notifications.
- Grid.js: Renders the interactive data table.
- jQuery: Facilitates DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.

== JavaScript Functionality

=== Data Fetching and Table Initialization

- Fetches inventory data from a specified endpoint and initializes a Grid.js table.
- Styles table cells based on conditions, such as quantity and stock status, to enhance user understanding at a glance.

=== Form Submission for Data Modification

- Prevents default form submission behavior to handle updates with custom logic.
- Includes logic to translate user-friendly form inputs into corresponding IDs required by the backend.
- Performs an AJAX `PUT` request to update the inventory data based on user inputs.
- On success, displays a modal confirming the update.

=== Dynamic Form Population

- On page load, fetches inventory data to populate the jar type dropdown, avoiding duplicate entries.
- Implements a mapping between jar types and their IDs to facilitate data modification.
- Listens for changes to the jar type selection, updating other form fields to reflect the selected jar's current details.

== Implementation Details

- Utilizes `async/await` for asynchronous data fetching.
- Employs JavaScript `Map` objects to maintain a lookup of jar types to IDs, which is crucial for form submission and data modification logic.
- Uses event listeners to handle form submission and to trigger dynamic updates to form fields based on user selection.

== Usage

This page is intended for administrators or users with permissions to update inventory details. It provides a user-friendly interface for maintaining accurate inventory records, essential for efficient inventory management.
