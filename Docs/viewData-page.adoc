= View Data Page Documentation for World of Jars

== Overview

The "View Data" page in the World of Jars inventory management system is designed to display the inventory in a user-friendly, interactive table. This page utilizes Grid.js to render inventory data dynamically, providing features like sorting, searching, and pagination to enhance user experience.

== Page Structure

Built with HTML5 and enhanced with Bootstrap for styling, the page includes a responsive navigation bar and a main content area where the data table is dynamically inserted. The integration of Grid.js allows for a rich interaction with the inventory data, directly within the browser.

=== Key Elements

- *Navigation Bar*: Facilitates easy navigation across the application, highlighting the current section.
- *Data Display Area*: Contains a placeholder (`#wrapper`) where the Grid.js table is rendered.

== External Dependencies

- Bootstrap: For layout and responsive design.
- Toastr: To display notifications, such as errors during data fetching.
- Grid.js: The core library used for generating the dynamic data table.
- jQuery and Firebase: Included for potential additional functionalities not explicitly covered in this snippet.

== JavaScript Functionality

=== Fetching Data

An asynchronous function, `fetchData`, is used to retrieve inventory data from a specified API endpoint. It handles both successful data retrieval and error scenarios, logging errors to the console if the fetch operation fails.

=== Initializing the Grid

The `initializeGrid` function takes the fetched data and initializes a Grid.js instance with it. The grid is configured to display columns for ID, Jar Type, Quantity, Location Name, and Status, with special formatters applied to the Quantity and Status columns for visual differentiation based on their values.

=== Data Visualization

- *Quantity*: Displayed with color coding—quantities above 5 are shown in green, otherwise in red—to quickly convey stock levels.
- *Status*: Also color-coded, showing "In Stock" items in green, "Out of Stock" or "Damaged" items in red, and others in black, providing an immediate visual cue about item availability.

== Implementation

To bring this functionality to life, include the JavaScript code in your page, ensuring the Grid.js library is loaded beforehand. Upon page load, `fetchData` is called with the API endpoint, and upon successful data retrieval, `initializeGrid` is invoked to render the table within the `#wrapper` container.

== Usage

This feature is crucial for inventory management, allowing users to view, sort, and search through inventory items efficiently. The dynamic data table enhances the accessibility and usability of the inventory data, making it an indispensable tool for the World of Jars application.
